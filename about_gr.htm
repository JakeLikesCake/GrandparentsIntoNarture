			<img border="0" src="images/gr1.jpg" width="301" height="250" align="right" style="border: 1px solid #000000" hspace="10" vspace="10" alt="Grandma Rocks (Barbara Joyce Frank)">Barbara 
			Joyce Frank, Ph.D., has been a trailblazer and advocate of 
			humanity’s profound connection to Nature and the Earth, for the past 
			40 years. <br>
			<br>
			As <i><b>Doc Rock</b></i> and through her <i><b>Grandparents 
			Into Nature</b></i>, Barbara’s mission is to motivate and empower 
			grandparents around the world to connect with their grandchildren 
			through the sharing of Nature. Being a grandmother of five 
			grandkids, she is discovering the joy of introducing them, as she 
			has done with people of all ages throughout her career, to the 
			Earth’s fascinating story and lessons for living. <br>
			<br>
			Barbara shares her Earth-systems knowledge to inspire grandparents 
			worldwide to encourage their grandkids to be our planet’s future 
			stewards. In this way, she is helping baby boomers to bond with 
			their grandchildren, as well as bring balance into the lives of 
			grandchildren who spend far too much time in cyberspace and too 
			little time outdoors. Her programs give grandparents the skills to 
			share Nature’s wisdom with their grandchildren, which bring joy, 
			wonder and a deep sense of belonging to both generations. <br>
			<br>
			Raised near the Atlantic Ocean, at a very early age Barbara felt a 
			deep sense of connection to Planet Earth. Throughout her life, she 
			has derived inspiration, guidance and comfort from Nature, and found 
			ways to share it with others worldwide. She encourages people to 
			bring Nature into their workplaces, schools and homes. Her mission 
			is to weave Nature’s wisdom into everyone’s life. She was green 
			decades before it was cool.<br>

			interdisciplinary environmental project on the effects of 
			urbanization on the flow of a South Carolinian river. After 
			completion of her doctorate, Barbara and her two children embarked 
			on an adventure, which would result in spending 15 years in Europe.<br>
			<br>
			University of Maryland University College hired Barbara as a faculty 
			member to develop a Geology program at its Munich, Germany Campus. 
			Her years of teaching were marked by the attendance of 25% of the 
			student body in her classes and study tours. She led 
			experiential-learning courses to Italy for volcanoes, Yugoslavia for 
			caves, and Austria and Switzerland for glaciers. <br>
			<br>
			Since returning to the United States, Barbara has worked for the 
			U.S. House of Representatives Science and Space and Technology 
			Committee, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and U.S. Department 
			of Energy. For the past decade, she has created a meeting and 
			training retreat center in naturally beautiful Great Falls, 
			Virginia, 30 minutes from Washington, DC, and five minutes from the 
			Potomac River. Her business, Meeting Oasis, is designed to help 
			nonprofit, government and corporate organizations to deal 
			innovatively with change, drawing on deep understanding of natural 
			systems. All the while, she guides people to experience joy and 
			meaning from a deep connection to Nature through teaching courses, 
			writing books, giving speeches, leading tours, and developing 
			educational products. <br>

			Carolina, 1973. Her doctoral research focused on the effects of 
			urbanization on the Reedy River, Greenville, South Carolina, 
			1941-71. Her M.S. in Organizational Development was earned at the 
			American University, 1997. Her thesis topic was on improving 
			communication between the U.S. Department of Energy’s 
			scientists/engineers and its public stakeholders regarding the 
			cleaning-up of nuclear waste sites nationwide.<br>
			<br>
			Among Barbara’s clients of Doc Rock Nature Programs, Team 
			Building and Retreat Center Programs have been Dunkin' Donuts, ExxonMobil, Ritz Carlton, Verizon, Freddie Mac, U.S. Grains Council, 
			U.S. Office of Personnel Management, American Red Cross, American 
			Diabetes Society, Friends of the Earth, International Foundation for 
			Electoral System, National Public Radio, The Nature Conservancy, 
			University of District of Columbia.<div align="center">
